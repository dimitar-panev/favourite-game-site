        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why I chose this game as my favorite.</h2>
        <p>I have always been a car enthusiast since a young age and also a gamer. When I went out with friends we used to ride our bikes and pretend that we are sport cars or just our favorite brand cars. I never really got the change to play any car games digitally cause I could not afford a console or a pc/laptop. That was until I turned 14 and got a cheap laptop in which I played a lot of GRID. 2 years later I got an xbox one and could finally play the game that I always wanted to try - Forza. The same that I got the console, I downloaded the game as well and couldn't stop playing it. Finally being able to play the game that I have always wanted to play was a feeling I cannot describe. Everyday when I got home from school I just sat on the couch, turned my console on and started playing forza horizon 4. Everything around did not matter except that game. I was only feeling like that playing that game and I cannot explain to myself why I felt that way.
        After a year I got really good at tuning cars, racing and drifting. In fact, I was so confident in my skills that I started uploading tiktok videos and started streaming on twich as well. 2 years later my family was not doing well financially and I had to sell my console. That made me very upset and sad since the thing that was really entertaining me for over a year got taken away from me. For a while I was trying to find similar games on android and ngl I did stumble upon some rip-off but nothing could beat the feeling of playing the real deal. 3 years later(2023) I got myself the gaming pc that I have always dreamed of. It was buffed, expensive, with really good parts. I could play any game on maximum graphics!!! I was finally able to enjoy playing Forza Horizon 4 again. Couple of months later and the next game released(Forza Horizon 5). I saved money and bought it a couple of months after it released. Since then I have been playing it almost everyday and If I have to be honest it was worth every penny. In conclusion the Forza Horizon series are my favorite because since the day I got it I think it has changed my life dramatically and has fulfilled the sad moments that I have felt sometimes. It made me feel like I have something of my own and that I am finally really good at something. I would recommend this game to every person that thoughts of buying it. It is 100% worth it and I will definitely keep buying the new releases.
