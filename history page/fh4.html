        <p>The game is set in an open world environment based in a fictionalised Great Britain, with regions that include condensed representations of Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District (including Derwentwater), Ambleside and the Cotswolds (including Broadway), Bamburgh among others. The game features a route creator which enables players to create races using completely customised routes.</p>

        <p>The game features a dynamic weather system that also depicts the change of seasons. The environment in the world will change depending on the season: for example, Derwentwater would freeze over in winter and allow players the ability to drive on the ice to reach areas of the game world that would be inaccessible during all the other seasons. The seasons are fixed across the game's servers, meaning that all players will experience the same conditions at the same time. After completing a prologue series of events which introduce players to all four seasons, the shared-world seasons will change every week, with the changes happening on Thursdays at 2:30 pm GMT.</p>

        <h3>Reception</h3>

        <p>
          Forza Horizon 4 received “universal acclaim” for the Xbox One version and “generally favourable” reviews for the PC version, according to Metacritic. The Xbox     One version is the highest-rated Forza Horizon title and is tied with Forza Motorsport and Forza Motorsport 3 as the highest-rated entry in the Forza series.
          The game was praised for its changing weather system, which added variety to races and sometimes required players to switch vehicles. The variety of challenges and activities was also appreciated. However, the festival system was criticized as confusing. The game’s attention to car-modelling detail was commended, offering different experiences for each of the 50 vehicles. The game world was criticized for feeling like an idealized version of England.</p>

        <p>
          The setting of Britain was considered less interesting than the previous game’s Australia, but the online modes were liked. The game was praised for its new additions, such as the ability to create custom courses and the return of more creative pursuits with story missions. The winter season received mixed reviews, being unique but potentially less fun due to the lack of traction.
          The game reached 7 million registered users after the launch of the Fortune Island expansion in January 2019. By June 2019, prior to the launch of the Lego Speed Champions expansion, the game had reached 10 million users. In August 2019, it was announced that the game had topped the 12 million player milestone. By November 2020, the game had been played by 24 million players since launch.</p>
