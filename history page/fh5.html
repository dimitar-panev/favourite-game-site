          The game is also set in a fictional representation of Mexico, featuring the largest map in the series, 50% larger than its predecessor, Forza Horizon 4. The map includes diverse features such as an active caldera volcano, jungles, beaches, ancient Mayan temples, and towns like Guanajuato. The game introduces a new local weather system that affects the eleven unique biomes on the map differently.</p>

          For the first time the game introduces a new Horizon Arcade with mini-multiplayer games, an EventLab for creating custom games and races, and a feature called “Forza Link”, an AI assistant that helps players connect and play together online. Accolades, a new feature, allows players to collect points and prizes for completing tasks.</p>

          The Eliminator battle royale game mode from Forza Horizon 4 returns, with players starting in a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle. Players can buy in-game houses to unlock rewards and the game features over 800 licensed vehicles.
          Due to licensing issues, vehicles from Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Lancia were not present in the base game, but they returned to the Forza series in the Series 24 update of the game on 17 August 2023.</p>
